mediagoblin-html5-multi-upload (0.10.0)
==============================

Mediagoblin v0.10.0 HTML5 multi-upload plugin.

This was originally based against mediagoblin v0.4.1, however with the latest merge to master has been reported to work with v0.9.0 (Thanks to tofay for the patch). 

Note: This version is incompatible with release v0.8.1 and earlier. Please try using a different branch or tag for an earlier version.

Forwards compatibilty with versions >0.9 is also not guaranteed. This plugin depends on functions in the standard upload form which mean as mediagoblin evolves this plugin can break, but please give it a try and let me know how you go so I can tag releases as working against particular mediagoblin versions.

To deploy, put the files from this github repository in your mediagoblin/plugins/ directory
Then, do:
<pre>
echo '[[mediagoblin.plugins.html5-multi-upload]]' >> /path/to/mediagoblin/mediagoblin_local.ini
</pre>
Then restart mediagoblin.

You should be able to reach the page at http://yoursite/html5-multi-upload/

Note that if using fcgi, you may need to increase the maximum size of a POST that it can process. I did this by adding this to my httpd configuration:
<pre>
# Accept up to 64MB requests
FcgidMaxRequestLen 67108864
</pre>
You'll probably have to do something similar for other methods aswell.

It requires HTML5 support to be able to add multiple files. Files are processed one at a time (at least with my instance). This was intentional, as I run my mediagoblin on a low power device with extremely limited CPU and RAM.

Hope this is useful for someone.
